# Description
The aim of this application is to build a workout tracker, which allows users to view, create and track daily workouts. As well as log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Including the ability to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user will be able to track my distance traveled.

This application runs on Heroku. 

# Installation 

You use the deployed application [here](https://pacific-meadow-48544.herokuapp.com/)

In order to use this application you will need to open the deployed application on Heroku.

From here you will either be able to start add a new workout.
When a workout has been added the last workout will be displayed on the home page and the user will also have the option to continue workout.

You will then be able to select if this is cardio or resistance and then you will be presented with areas to input your workout details.

Once you have done this you can either add another workout or click 'Dashboard', which will show you graphs of your workout and how this compares to your previous workouts.
